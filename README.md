# Version 1.1 Updates

- Complete redesign - Retro Theme
- Responsive - Built on Flexbox
- CSS written in SASS

# Version 1.0 Problems

- no charset specified - should update to UTF-8
- no `<meta name="viewport" />` tags specified
- entire body is built on a table which is fine for emails, but web pages should be building using semantic HTML (sections, divs, p etc)
- alt tag on #hero img is misspelled
- #hero id is used twice on line 10 & 17 - should switch to a class
- `<blink>` tag is deprecated - should not be used.
- third reason in why pogs section reads weird, should be changed to something like “pogs are biodegradable”
- pog3 has the wrong path - should be img/pog-3.jpg
- pog images have missing alt tags
